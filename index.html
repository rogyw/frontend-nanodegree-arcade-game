  <p>The player moves one space at a time up, down, left, or right.<strong>Keyboard: </strong> To move, press and release the keyboard arrow keys (Up/Down/Left/Right).</p>
  <p><strong>Mouse:</strong> To move, click and release the mouse in the square to move to beside the current location.</p>
  <p><strong>Game Restart:</strong> Refresh the browser page (F5).</p>
  <p><strong>Scoring:</strong> Each time the player jumps into the puddle one point is earned and the player is safely transported back to the grass ready to try again. If the player touches a bug they lose a life and restart from the grass.</p>
