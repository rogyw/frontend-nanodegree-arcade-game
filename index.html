    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p><strong>The Object of the game:</strong> Move the boy/girl up to the water supply - avoiding the bugs travelling along the pavement. </p>
    <p><strong>How to Play:</strong>To move, press and release the keyboard arrow keys (Up/Down/Left/Right). To restart, refresh the page.
    <p><strong>Scoring:</strong> Each time the player reaches the water one point is earned and the player is safely transported back to the grass. If the player touches a bug they lose a life and restart from the grass.</p>
    <p>Have fun!</p>
