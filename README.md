The object of the game:
To move the boy/girl up to jump into the big puddle - avoiding the bugs travelling along the pavement.

How to Play:
To move, press and release the keyboard arrow keys (Up/Down/Left/Right).
To restart, refresh the browser page (F5).

Scoring:
Each time the player jumps into the puddle one happy point is earned and the player is safely transported back to the grass ready to try again.
If the player is touches a bug they lose a life and restart from the grass.

Have fun!
